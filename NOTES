Don't use this on a machine that you value. It will crash.

Linux kernel version used for development/testing: 4.17.11.
See git branches for other kernel versions.

As is, writers modify whole pages only. Is this a problem?

---
Maybe we should get rid of the generic link idea and switch to
something like overlayfs that sits above another mount point?
Just an idea...but that would be a big re-write :(

Adding an experimental mount -o option, where option is a default path to create
files. This will buy some time with the link approach. We can, at mount time,
specify where to populate links. This is very preliminary...

Right now the default path is /dev/shm if no option is specified.

shim checks for missing backing files as required and will create new ones in
mount option path when necessary.


---
The module parameter 'read_ahead' that defaults to 1024 pages. Use
it to set the number of read ahead pages.
---
Basic pass-through read and write operations are now supported, but bugs below.
AIO and iovec are not supported.
---
Pipes, unix sockets, etc. are not supported, but also not tested against and
might crash things if attempted. XXX
---
The module opens the backing file for read/write as soon as a link is created.

---

Issue an lseek/read with a null buffer to update the page cache from the
backing file (reverse msync).

Use the standard msync system call to force writeback of dirty pages
in the page cache to the backing file.

------------- other bugs and problems -----------------

what about directories? Not implemented and may crash if used...

Some set attribute settings result in crashes? Fix.
