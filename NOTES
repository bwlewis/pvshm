Multiple writer support with finer than page granularity is now supported.

Basic pass-through read and write operations are now supported. AIO is
not supported.

The pvshm module requires a recent (ca 2.6.31) vanilla Linux kernel. We include
a hack to support older RHEL kernels used by Amazon EC2 (< 2.6.27), but use
with Linux kernel versions prior to 2.6.31 at your own risk.  Pvshm is known to
crash on x86_64 2.6.28x kernels used in Ubuntu 9.04, don't use it on that OS.
It's tested working on x86 and x86_64 2.6.31x kernels used in Ubuntu 9.10 and
on x86_64 2.6.32x kernels used in Ubuntu 10.04.

The module opens the backing file for read/write as soon as a link
is created.

Error checking and some important features are inadequate:
In particular:

  - Memory mappings must not exceed backing file size.
(this should be fixed)

Moral? Don't use this on a machine that you value. It will crash.

UML hostfs is very similar to this.
FUSE shared-writable mmap is similar to this (if it really exists?).

Manual cache control:
Issue an lseek/read with a null buffer to update the page cache from the
backing file (reverse msync).

Use the standard msync system call to force writeback of dirty pages
in the page cache to the backing file.
