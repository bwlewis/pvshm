Linux kernel version used for development/testing: 4.17.11.
See git branches for other kernel versions.

---
There is a new kernel parameter 'read_ahead' that defaults to 1024 pages. Use
it to set the number of read ahead pages.
---
Basic pass-through read and write operations are now supported, but bugs below.
AIO and iovec are not supported.
---
The module opens the backing file for read/write as soon as a link is created.

Error checking and some important features are inadequate, but improving. In
particular:

  - Memory mappings must not exceed backing file size. (this should be fixed)

Moral? Don't use this on a machine that you value. It will crash.

Issue an lseek/read with a null buffer to update the page cache from the
backing file (reverse msync).

Use the standard msync system call to force writeback of dirty pages
in the page cache to the backing file.

------------- other bugs and problems -----------------

shim_write (pass-through write to backing file) doesn't make sense and probably
doesn't work...  for instance, what if the file size changes?

shim_create/shim_mkdir/shim_mknod not working and crashes.
How to handle file creation (without link)?
what about directories?
what about file delete (not unlink)???

Overall, how should file creation, write, truncate, etc. be handled in shim? It
*would* be nice to support this within shim, somehow, for use with exm.  ???

Many set attribute settings result in crashes. Fix.

shim_read is unused, other file operations incomplete


linking read-only file works, but readpages crashes. ??

filp_open seems to open read-only files with O_RDWR flag without error?
